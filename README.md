# Enhancing Spotify User Experience Through Data-Driven Insights

## Project Overview

This project aims to extract valuable insights from Spotify's extensive dataset, which includes various musical features. By conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA), this notebook seeks to enhance Spotify's playlist curation, improve music recommendation algorithms, and develop personalized marketing strategies. The analysis focuses on leveraging data to improve user engagement and optimize Spotifyâ€™s features.

### Key Stakeholders
- **Product Managers**: Utilize insights to enhance user interactions through smarter music recommendations and more engaging user interfaces.
- **Marketing Teams**: Leverage findings to create targeted marketing campaigns based on users' musical preferences.
- **Data Science & Analytics Teams**: Use deep insights to drive data-informed decisions and improve recommendation algorithms, genre classification, and mood-based playlist curation.

## Dataset Description

- **Dataset Source**: Spotify Features dataset.
- **Number of Records**: 232,725 rows
- **Number of Features**: 18 columns
- **Key Columns**:
  - `genre`, `artist`, `track_name`, `popularity`
  - Audio features such as `acousticness`, `danceability`, `energy`, `instrumentalness`, `liveness`, `loudness`, `speechiness`, `tempo`, and `valence`.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook begins by loading and exploring the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics:

1. **Data Exploration**: 
   - Data type checks
   - Summary statistics of features
   - Checking for missing values and duplicates
   
2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handling missing values
   - Removing duplicates (if any)

3. **Feature Analysis**:
   - Visualizations to analyze the distribution of key audio features.
   - Correlation analysis between variables to understand relationships.
   - Insights into popular genres, artists, and track characteristics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation
  - `seaborn`, `matplotlib` for visualizations
  - `scikit-learn` for data preprocessing
